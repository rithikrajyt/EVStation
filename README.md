# About
iCharge- A one stop solution for all your Charging needs.
This website helps the user to find the EV charging stations along with the number of spare charging ports,number of vehicles in queue and the estimated waiting time at the charging station. 
User can prebook a Charging port at a particular charging station at a  time according to his/her wishes.
We also have the prime membership in which a user gets access to separate ports at every charging station. 

# Problem and Solution

Problem:- Electric Vehicles are increasing at a very fast rate in India. It is expected that there would be more than 50 Million 2-Wheeler EV and 20 Million 4-Wheeler Electric vehicle will run on Indian roads till year 2025.The Electric Vehicles take minimum 30 minutes  to get full charge in one of the fastest charging ports other than that EV's take more than 1 hour to get fully charged.

Solution:- We have came with the solution of iCharge- EV Charging station where you can see the number of vehicles in queue at a specific charging station near you, also you can get nevigation to that location and even you can book time slot for charging your vehicle in advance at different charging stations near you. We have used Google Maps Api for locating different charging stations and we will use computer vision technology camera at each station to check how many vehicles are in queue for charging.
